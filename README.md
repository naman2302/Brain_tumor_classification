# Brain Tumor Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of brain tumors using MRI images. It leverages a dataset of MRI images to train a model capable of distinguishing between different types of brain tumors or identifying the presence of a tumor.

## Overview

The project is structured to perform the following key tasks:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading MRI image data and preparing it for training, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
* **Model Building:** Constructing a CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
* **Training:** Training the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset.
* **Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance on a test dataset.
* **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict the presence or type of brain tumors in new MRI images.

## Repository Contents

* **`Brain_tumor_classification.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the brain tumor classification pipeline.
* **`README.md`:** Project documentation (this file).
* **`dataset`:** Directory containing the MRI image dataset. (Note: Due to size limitations, the actual dataset may need to be downloaded separately and placed in this directory. See "Dataset" section below.)

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

* **TensorFlow:** For building and training the CNN model.
* **Keras:** High-level API for building neural networks (part of TensorFlow).
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing.
* **Scikit-learn:** For model evaluation.
* **OS:** For operating system interactions.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The MRI image dataset is crucial for training the model. You'll likely need to download and place the data into the `dataset` folder. The exact source of the dataset should be specified. Common sources for such datasets include:

* Kaggle datasets
* Medical imaging repositories (e.g., TCIA)

**Important:** Due to the large size of medical image datasets, they are often not included directly in the repository. Please refer to the original repository's instructions or search online for appropriate brain tumor MRI datasets.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/naman2302/Brain_tumor_classification.git](https://github.com/naman2302/Brain_tumor_classification.git)
    cd Brain_tumor_classification
    ```

2.  **Download and place the dataset:**

    * Obtain the MRI image dataset.
    * Place the dataset within the `dataset` directory. Ensure the directory structure is compatible with the code in the Jupyter Notebook.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt #if a requirements.txt file exists. Or install as shown in the dependencies section above.
    ```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Brain_tumor_classification.ipynb
    ```

5.  **Follow the instructions within the notebook:**

    * Execute the cells sequentially to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
    * Modify parameters and experiment with different architectures as needed.

## Model Architecture

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The specifics of the architecture (number of layers, filter sizes, etc.) are detailed within the `Brain_tumor_classification.ipynb` notebook. Common CNN layers include:

* Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`)
* Max pooling layers (`MaxPooling2D`)
* Flatten layer (`Flatten`)
* Dense (fully connected) layers (`Dense`)
* Dropout layers (`Dropout`)

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

## Potential Improvements

* **Data Augmentation:** Implement more advanced data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for transfer learning.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods to combine multiple models for improved accuracy.
* **Segmentation:** Implement brain tumor segmentation before classification to improve accuracy.
* **3D CNN:** For better utilization of MRI volume data, implement a 3D CNN.
